#COURSE OVERVIEW

Introduces technologies used to build leading-edge application systems and services on the World Wide Web. Coverage includes a selection of Web components such as mark-up and scripting languages and frameworks for building systems. 

This course is the first of two that teach modern techniques for creating Web Systems and Services. INFO 151 concerns itself with the client side of the Web Services client/server architecture. Topics include:
•	Web page creation & deployment using XHTML and CSS
•	Creating dynamic web pages using JavaScript
•	Using AJAX for creating interactive web applications and rich Internet applications.

Lectures (typically on Tuesday) will adhere closely to the book chapters. We will have weekly assignments (labs, typically on Thursdays) for you to practice on what you have learned. The instructor will provide you with additional resources of a summary or tutorial nature just to refresh your knowledge of the basics of the topics. We will be covering a lot of materials during the term. To prevent being overwhelmed, you must commit to following the readings, handouts, lectures and lab materials closely. Come see me or your lab instructor whenever you have questions.
