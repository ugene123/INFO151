# INFO 151 - Web Systems and Services I

## COURSE OVERVIEW 

Introduces technologies used to build leading-edge application systems and services on the World Wide Web. Coverage includes a selection of Web components such as mark-up and scripting languages and frameworks for building systems. 

This course is the first of two that teach modern techniques for creating Web Systems and Services. INFO 151 concerns itself with the client side of the Web Services client/server architecture. Topics include:
•	Web page creation & deployment using XHTML and CSS
•	Creating dynamic web pages using JavaScript
•	Using AJAX for creating interactive web applications and rich Internet applications.

Lectures (typically on Tuesday) will adhere closely to the book chapters. We will have weekly assignments (labs, typically on Thursdays) for you to practice on what you have learned. The instructor will provide you with additional resources of a summary or tutorial nature just to refresh your knowledge of the basics of the topics. We will be covering a lot of materials during the term. To prevent being overwhelmed, you must commit to following the readings, handouts, lectures and lab materials closely. Come see me or your lab instructor whenever you have questions.


## COURSE ASSESSMENT 

The course’s evaluation is based on homework/lab assignments to help refine and demonstrate your understanding of the material from the lectures, an individual/group project and presentation, and two exams.

## TERM PROJECT AND PRESENTATION  

There will be a project based on the course material. The individual/team project is due at the end of the class (week 11).

The project will consist of your own web page development with technologies covered in the course: XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can be any topics/theme. Projects can be done in pairs; but it is okay if you choose to work alone. Early in the term, pair up (if you want to work in a pair) and decide on an appropriate project by Week 6. Though you can choose any theme for your web page, but your project topic must be approved by me before you start working on it. Please let me know what you are doing shortly after the mid-term (Week 6). We will discuss this in more detail in class.
