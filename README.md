## COURSE ASSESSMENT 

The course’s evaluation is based on homework/lab assignments to help refine and demonstrate your understanding of the material from the lectures, an individual/group project and presentation, and two exams.

## TERM PROJECT AND PRESENTATION  

There will be a project based on the course material. The individual/team project is due at the end of the class (week 11).

The project will consist of your own web page development with technologies covered in the course: XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can be any topics/theme. Projects can be done in pairs; but it is okay if you choose to work alone. Early in the term, pair up (if you want to work in a pair) and decide on an appropriate project by Week 6. Though you can choose any theme for your web page, but your project topic must be approved by me before you start working on it. Please let me know what you are doing shortly after the mid-term (Week 6). We will discuss this in more detail in class.
